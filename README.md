# Coding-Stratagems
My personal accumulation of best pratices and strategies in software development

## Essential
- Always check the limits of data types to make sure maximum value can be stored. Otherwise, overflow will caluse unexpected errors, which are runtime. (e.g. int data type cannot hold 14 factorial)

## Variables 
- Global Variable should never be used unless there is no other way, because the code with global variables is not modular


## Object Oriented

## C++
- Use of inline functions is more efficient
- Use '\n' instead of endl
