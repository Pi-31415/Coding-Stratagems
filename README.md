# Coding-Stratagems
My personal accumulation of best pratices and strategies in software development

## Variables 
- Global Variable should never be used unless there is no other way, because the code with global variables is not modular


## Object Oriented

## C++
- Use of inline functions is more efficient
- Use '\n' instead of endl
